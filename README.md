# Data Mining Project 1

## Overview
This README details the Assignment 1 findings from the CISC 5790: Data Mining course, focusing on the impact of lambda values on Mean Squared Error (MSE) for various datasets.

## Key Findings

- **Lambda Optimization**: Optimal lambda values minimizing test set MSE were identified, demonstrating regularization's importance.
- **Cross-Validation Analysis**: Compares optimal lambda and MSE values from CV with initial analysis, highlighting CV's benefits and drawbacks.
- **Learning Curves**: Plots show how model performance changes with increasing lambda, illustrating bias-variance trade-offs.

## Methodology
The project utilized MSE calculations and CV to evaluate regularization effects on model performance, employing plots to visualize lambda's impact on MSE.

## Conclusions
Choosing the right lambda for regularization is crucial to minimize MSE. CV is useful for identifying optimal lambda values, and learning curves offer insights into bias and variance balance for improved accuracy.
